To run from localhost, enter this at docroot:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Outstanding bugs:
- Elite traffic spike’s 12 nodes of incoming traffic can be too wide for the space. Should have a background image w/ fade for the left-side text.
— Need to figure out how to rearrange icons (so fileserver appears last instead of first).
— Highlighted node stopped working (flashes border stroke for some reason. Need to fix.)

Legacy bugs (from previous version):
— Cannot refresh the page for anything but Basic w/o having things look wrong.
— If you click off a highlighted element (such as index server), it remains highlighted (should be resolvable). Also should be able to press escape to close.
